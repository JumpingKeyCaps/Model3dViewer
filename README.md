**Model3DViewer** is a mobile Android application that demonstrates how to render and manipulate **3D models** using a **WebView** embedded in a **Jetpack Compose** interface.

This is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** that combines native Android capabilities with web-based 3D rendering powered by **three.js**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

**Context**:  
Integrating immersive 3D visualizations in modern Android apps can enhance user interaction and design. This project shows how to embed and control 3D content using `three.js` inside a native Jetpack Compose app.

**Objectives**:  
- Render 3D models in an Android WebView.
- Enable interaction via touch gestures and sensors.
- Implement reusable Compose screens for various use cases.
- Showcase a bridge between Kotlin and JavaScript.
- Ensure offline rendering by bundling all 3D scripts locally.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Features

- Render **3D models** (STL, GLTF, GLB) with **three.js** inside a WebView.
- Use **OrbitControls** for touch-based interaction (rotate, zoom).
- Load custom 3D files from **device storage**.
- Display the 3D model **above the UI** with a transparent WebView.
- Rotate the model using **device sensors** (gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer).
- Configure lighting and camera through a dynamic bottom sheet.
- Full support for **offline mode** (no network required).

## üß© Integration of three.js & Module Handling

During development, one of the main challenges was using **three.js modules** in a WebView context. Since **WebViews in Android do not support ES6 module syntax (e.g., `import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/...')**, we had to find an alternative approach.

### üõ† Solutions Implemented

- All necessary three.js scripts (including `three.min.js`, `OrbitControls.js`, `GLTFLoader.js`, etc.) were **manually downloaded and bundled** inside the `/assets` folder of the Android app.
- Instead of using `import` statements, we switched to **global script loading via `<script>` tags**, maintaining compatibility with the WebView runtime.
- 3D model loading, scene creation, and interaction logic were written inside a local `index.html` file, using global references to three.js components.

### üì¶ Advantages

- Full **offline support**, no CDN or internet required.
- Avoids CORS or MIME-type issues when loading modules locally.
- Works seamlessly across all Android versions supporting WebView.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- Can‚Äôt use modern ES Modules (`import`) or NPM-based three.js structure (Android JS file locker, so i use the oldi 0.125.0 build).
- Debugging JavaScript inside WebView can be limited compared to browser tools.
- Need to keep scripts updated manually if three.js releases new features or fixes.

This approach ensures **maximum compatibility** while preserving the power of three.js in a constrained Android WebView environment.

## üéØ Final Result

‚úÖ Embedded 3D models directly in a Jetpack Compose UI.  
‚úÖ Works entirely offline with locally bundled JS.  
‚úÖ Advanced interaction via touch and sensors.  
‚úÖ Modular, reusable Composable screens for 3D rendering.  
‚úÖ Complete separation between native and Web logic through a communication bridge.
